Today is still a very tired day. Java is finally coming to an end. China's sick inner volume is really unbearable. Really, I can only say that it is very painful. Under this high-intensity system, new technologies will not be born. It will only infinitely prolong people's endurance. Who can bear more hardship and who is cheaper. Chinese people are selling their dignity, In exchange for a so-called high salary. It's too difficult. It's said that even civil servants will be involved. The most ridiculous thing is that even if the degree of internal involvement is so, most people will still go to internal involvement. Just like teachers who have to get up so early every day and low wages, they tell about the bad teachers, but no one resigns. They are all boasting for a while. If they really have to take action, they all seem to be hanging high. Ridiculous.
